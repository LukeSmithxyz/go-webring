    <h2>What is a webring?</h2>

    <p>A webring is an alliance of sites which link to their "neighbors" in a circular way. Each site places "Next site" and "Previous site" links which, if a user continues to follow, he will see every site in the ring and end up where he started.</p>

    <p>This is a classic way to discover artisanal sites on the internet without the mediation of search engines, "big tech" or corporate landing pages.</p>

    <h2>Table of members</h2>

    <p>(The webring program will fill this list with the webring member sites.)</p>

    <ul>
    {{ . }}
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <p>Here you can list the instructions for joining the webring, which will resemble the following:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Add the required links to your site (see below).</li>
        <li>Email the administrator of the webring giving him the URL and name of your site.</li>
        <li>Wait for approval.</li>
    </ol>


    <h3>Required linkage</h3>

    <p>There are four main links that the webring provides:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><code>/next</code> &ndash; Go to the next site in the ring.</li>
        <li><code>/previous</code> &ndash; Go to the previous site in the ring.</li>
        <li><code>/</code> &ndash; Go to the webring mainpage (this page of yours).</li>
        <li><code>/random</code> &ndash; Go to a random page in the webring.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Note that if a site not integrated into the webring links to <code>/next</code> or <code>/previous</code>, or if no HTTP referer is detected, they will also direct to random sites.</p>

    <p>All of these links can be integrated into a block like the following, which should appear on every participating page (although perhaps with some styling differences).</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div style="text-align:center"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://example.com/previous"&gt;←&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="https://example.com/"&gt;Name of Webring&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="https://example.com/next"&gt;→&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;a href="https://example.com/random"&gt;Random&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

    <p>Note that <code>example.com</code> here is the URL of the webring mainpage.</p>

    <p>This will appear as:</p>

    <div style="text-align:center">
    <a href="https://example.com/previous">←</a>
    <a href="https://example.com/">Name of Webring</a>
    <a href="https://example.com/next">→</a>
    </br>
    <a href="https://example.com/random">Random</a>
    </div>

    <p>Once an applicant site has the proper links on his page, he may submit his page for approval.
    Once approved, the site will receive "neighbors" in the webring and will appear in the list/ring for others.</p>
